## Getting Started

## Front-End 

## API Service

## Introduction

The purpose of this software is to provide Hebrew language students with an efficient and enjoyable way of practicing verb conjugations. In addition, developers may access the API which provides data relating to over 100k conjugated Hebrew verbs and related information.

Hebroots recognizes the difficulties of learning verb conjugations and leverages its structural/mathematical nature together with mobile technology to teach it in the most effective, accessible way possible. 

### Why practice verb conjugations? 

Hebrew is just one of the many languages in which verb conjugation confuses its speakers. As a reference, *Oxford Languages* defines [verb] conjugation as “changing the form of (a word) to express a particular grammatical function or attribute, typically tense, mood, person, number, case, and gender.” With Hebrew (along with several other languages), verb conjugation is taught and reviewed at nearly every academic level. It is a topic that for a long time has stumbled the minds of its learners, but once understood its power is hardly dismissed. 

Understanding verb conjugations enables Hebrew learners to improve at an exponential rate. Once a learner knows a pattern (explained below), she is equipped with the ability to identify and manipulate verbs in nearly every context.

>Hebrew Verbs can be classified into any one of the seven binyanim
(בניינים (Each binyan portrays a particular aspect of the shoresh (שורש" (root".
The word binyan in Hebrew means "a building" or "structure". The idea is that
we can build all verbs by obeying certain rules, and that Hebrew Verbs have
structure. Binyan comes from the three-letter shoresh: bet-nun-hey (בנה (which
is related to another shoresh: bet-yud-nun (בין (which means "understanding".
Through structure we can understand Hebrew verbs.

### How to learn verb conjugations

Before starting, there is **one** concept which must be understood - ROOTS (hence the name *hebroots*).
> The vast majority of words in the Hebrew language can be boiled down to a three-consonant root word that contains the essence of the word's meaning.  For example, the first word of the Torah is "bereishit", meaning in the beginning.  The root is Resh-Alef-Shin, which means head or first.  (See Hebrew Alphabet to learn the letters).  It is the same root as the "Rosh" in "Rosh Hashanah" (first of the year, i.e., Jewish New Year).

Every verb in Hebrew has a 3-4 letter root which is essentially what I like to call *the variable inputted into the conjugation formula in each instance.* 
This will become more clear as we move along. 
Basically what you need to know is that the dashes (-) below are *placeholders* and when the methods mentioned are applied in practice, 
they are replaced with roots. 

The typical approach to learning verb conjugations involves: 

1) Selecting a verb pattern. Hebrew verbs can belong to one of 7 patterns… 

Pattern | Phonetic | Aspect | Infinitive Form | Example (כ.ת.ב)
------- | -------- | ------ | --------------- | -------
 פעל | Pa’al | simple active | - ל - - ו | לכתוב
פיעל | Pi’el | intensive active | - - - ל | לכתב 
הפעיל | Hiph’il | causative active | - לה - - י | להכתיב
התפעל | Hitpa’el | reflexive, cooperative | - - - להת | להתכתב
הופעל | Huph’al | passive of no. 3 | אין | הוכתב
פועל | Pu’al | passive of no. 2 | אין | כותב
נפעל | niph’al | passive of no. 1, simple active | - - - להי | להיכתב

2) Reviewing how the verb pattern is conjugated in one or all of the 4 tenses (Past, Present, Future, Imperitive) as pertaining to each Subjective Personal Pronoun (I, you, he, she, we, they) with example. 

Ex.

Pattern: Pi’el  
Tense: Past  
Infinitive form: ---ל  
Example: לדבר (to speak)  
Example (ד.ב.ר) | Conjugation | Pronoun | Translation (pronoun + conjugation) 
------- | ----------- | ------- | ----------
דיברתי | י--תי- | אני | I spoke
דיברת | י--ת- | אתה | You (m.) spoke
דיברת | י--ת- | את | You (f.) spoke
דיבר | י--- | הוא | He spoke
דיברה | י--ה- | היא | She spoke
דיברנו | י--נו- | אנחנו | We spoke
דיברו | י--ו- | הם | They (m.) spoke
דיברו | י--ו- | הן | They (f.) spoke
דיברתם | י--תם- | אתם | You all (m.) spoke
דיברתן | י--תן- | אתן | You all (f.) spoke

3) Recognize the power of verb conjugation.  
If you know the verb pattern Pi’el, and how to say “I spoke with the teacher” then you immediately also know how to say “They spoke with the teacher,” which in Hebrew has a conjugative difference.  
English - the verb remains the same  
- I **spoke** with the teacher  
- They **spoke** with the teacher  
Hebrew - the verb changes with the pronoun  
- אני **דיברתי** עם המורה  
- הם **דיברו** עם המורה 

### How hebroots helps

Hebroots is being developed to help Hebrew learners (and soon hopefully other language learners) around the globe practice and understand the full power of verb conjugation. 

The goal is to combine traditional teaching methods together with interactive mobile learning techniques and other useful features like a search engine. 

The client will possess the following features: 

1. Search and see - a flexible search that provides the full conjugations of any verb in Hebrew

2. Pattern lessons - professionally built and designed lessons that introduce learners to new patterns or concepts 

3. Training Journey - a pre-built user-custom series of lessons and games for the user to capture all the app has to offer

4. Specific Training Selection - a pre-game screen in which a user selects the style of her training

5. Training Games - typing and speaking games in which users 

6. Settings

### Scalability

In the future, hebroots can be expanded to support more languages that require a conjugative understanding. It can also support more translation languages. In the meantime, a translation API might suffice. Additionally, more than just verb conjugation but number conjugation, gender, and other topics are being looked into.
